# Medical_Cost_Regression_Analysis
How does U.S. insurance companies determine how much each everyone pays for insurance premiums? Could someone’s smoking habit influence how much they pay for health care expenses? What about personal medical history such as person’s age or body mass index (BMI)? Or what about where people live and or how many kids they have? To answer some of these questions, I worked on a predictive analysis data science project using a medical care related dataset. Through this project, I looked at what’s influencing how much people are paying for insurance premiums or medical expenses in general. Furthermore, I did a regression analysis and predicted how much insurance premiums will go up in the future. I used various machine learning regression methods and determined which method yields the most accurate results. The dataset that was utilized for this project is “Medical Cost Personal Dataset” from Kaggle. This dataset wasfirst published in data scientist Brett Lantz’s 2013 book, Machine Learning with R
